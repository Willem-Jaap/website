Maybe you have encountered the following problem: You clone a project and run `pnpm install`. Suddenly `pnpm-lock.yaml` appears in your Git tab with changes to the entire file. Most likely the lock file version has changed.

This lockfile was generated with a different package manager than the one you are using. This is a common problem when working in a team with different package managers. To avoid this, you can specify the package manager you are using in your `package.json` file.

```json
{
    "name": "@willem-jaap/my-project",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "react": "^18.3.1"
    },
    "packageManager": "pnpm@9.4.0"
}
```

In this example, we specify that we are using pnpm version 9.4.0.

## Corepack

Corepack is an experimental tool included in Node.js to help with managing versions of your package managers.

To enable Corepack, run the following command:

```bash
corepack enable
```

This will download the specified package manager version.

If you do not have a package manager specified in your `package.json` file, you can use Corepack add this information to your `package.json` file. This wil add the latest version of pnpm to your `package.json` file.

```bash
corepack use pnpm@latest
```

## Conclusion

By specifying the package manager you are using in your `package.json` file, you can avoid conflicts with lock files and make it easier for your team to know which package manager to use.
