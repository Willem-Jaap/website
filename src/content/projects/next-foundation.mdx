Next foundation is a project that I created to help me bootstrap new projects. It aims very solid architecture for scalable Next.js projects for which I had the following requirements in mind:

**Typesafe**: The project must be type safe. From props to api calls to internationalization.

**Scaleable**: I want the project to be scalable. The project is maintained by Pixel Perfect Agency and we want to be able to scale for large projects. Next foundation is not the source of truth for Pixel Perfect Agency, we apply things we learn from our projects to Next foundation.

**Consistent**: We love consistent code at Pixel Perfect Agency. We want to be able to jump into any project and know where to find things, also we maintain strict linting rules with ESLint and Prettier.
