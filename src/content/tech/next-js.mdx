Next.js is the best frontend framework I have used. Although some people consider Next a fullstack framework I mostly use it for frontend projects.

That said, Next is way more powerful than a traditional frontend framework, the built-in optimizations for images, fonts and the general developer experience with file/folder-based routing is very pleasing.

The new App Router is very cool and brings very cool new ideas to the table when it comes to how web applications are built.
