summary: Tailwind has become increasingly popular in the last few years. The utility first nature of the framework gives you an incredible amount of flexibility. However, the “copy-paste” culture that comes with it can be a double-edged sword. In this article, I'll walk you through the concepts of “leaf components”, “composition” and “variants” to build a robust design-system with TailwindCSS.

## What is a design system?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together like building blocks to build apps and websites in a consistent and efficient way.

Lets take a look at a simple example. A very common element is the **button**. A button can have different states, like `primary`, `secondary`, `disabled`, `loading`, etc. It can also have different sizes, like `small`, `medium`, `large`, etc.

<div className="not-prose flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4 my-8">
    <button className="px-5 py-2 bg-violet-600 text-white rounded-md shadow-md">Primary</button>
    <button className="px-5 py-2 bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-md shadow-md">Secondary</button>
    <button
        className="px-5 py-2 bg-gray-500 text-white rounded-md shadow-md disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
        disabled>
        Disabled
    </button>
    <button className="flex items-center px-5 py-2 bg-violet-600 text-white rounded-md shadow-md">
        <svg className="animate-spin h-5 w-5 -ml-1 mr-3" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <circle
                className="opacity-25"
                cx="12"
                cy="12"
                r="10"
                stroke="currentColor"
                strokeWidth="4"></circle>
            <path
                className="opacity-75"
                fill="currentColor"
                d="M4 12a8 8 0 018-8V0C5.373 0 0 5.373 0 12h4zm2 5.291A7.962 7.962 0 014 12H0c0 3.042 1.135 5.824 3 7.938l3-2.647z"></path>
        </svg>
        Loading...
    </button>
    <span className="block w-[1px] h-8 bg-charade-500 mx-2" />
    <button className="px-4 py-1 bg-violet-600 text-white rounded-md shadow-md text-sm">
        Small
    </button>
    <button className="px-4 py-1 bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-md shadow-md text-sm">
        Small
    </button>
</div>

As you can see, a button can have a lot of different states. If you don't extract this into a reusable component, you'll end up with a lot of duplicate code with the potential of inconsistencies. Especially when you're working with a team.

```tsx
<Button variant="primary" href="/blog" className="my-10 md:mb-20">
    Primary
    <ChevronRight />
</Button>
```
